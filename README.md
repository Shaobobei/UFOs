# UFO

## Dana wants to create a webpage and dynamic table
She’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, we added table filters for the city, state, country, and shape

## Resources used
• Data Source: data.js

• Software program: visual Studio Code

# How it works:
The first thing that a user will see when they open the website Is the default page with a brief description about the research and how some people like W. Avy and V. Isualize feels about the idea of aliens and a long list of all the sightings

Over to the left side they will see the filter search bar with some information already filled out, but they are just place holders. Once the matching criteria is entered our JavaScript will filter through the data and populate the sightings

They can search by exact information or if they are looking for a specific sighting, they can fill out all the boxes and if the entered information is in the dataset the sighting will populate.

Or they can play around with the filter by entering one criteria at a time, Here I just entered “el cajon” and 5 sighting populated even if they aren't on the same date

## Summary
For those who are interested and/or maybe doing research on this topic, this website will be very helpful, they can get all their information from one place; but there is a slight drawback; even if you just want to “play around” with the filter, you’d still have to be pretty specific about what is being entered. One example Ive noticed is that its case sensitive. If I want to look up "spring valley” it will only work if I type in "spring valley” nothing will populate if I use a capital “S” in spring.

Reading through the comments line I notice most of them are descriptions of what they saw. I think adding some photos (if there are any) or maybe even some drawings of those description in as part of the filter would be very visually pleasing for the users.

I also think adding an “ENTER” or “SEARCH” button in the filter table would make the website a little more user friendly, I would imagine that some people would NOT know they simply had to hit the physical “ENTER” button on the keyboard to start the search.
